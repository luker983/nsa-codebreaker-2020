Journalist by day. New Blogger by night. Traveler when able. Pet lover...always.

Skyler here. Welcome to the 'Diary of an Exotic Furry Voyager'. Outside of work, my two favorite things are traveling the world and getting to come home to my favorite furry little friend, and the best friend on the planet, Bodie. This blog is going to account for some of my travels and more importantly, the animals I meet on the way. Hope you enjoy!
